About
-----
* Visual analytics software integrated our research results including:
  * Brain network comparison between groups, individuals, and scan sessions
  
* This project is a work for the paper below.
  * Takanori Fujiwara, Jia-Kai Chou, Andrew M. McCullough, Charan Ranganath, and Kwan-Liu Ma, "A Visual Analytics System for Brain Functional Connectivity Comparison across Individuals, Groups, and Time Points". In Proceedings of IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis), 2017

* Note: Currently, for macOS, the 3D brain network visualziation part has rendering issues due to macOS's OpenGL support.
